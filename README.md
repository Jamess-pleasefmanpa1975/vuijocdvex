Just walked out of Demon City and man, my brain feels like it's been tossed around a rollercoaster that's on fire. Not in a good way, you know? I was hoping for some horror masterpiece but it's more like a fever dream brought to you by a caffeinated squirrel. Seriously, I'm still trying to catch my breath. Maybe it's just me, but when a   throws more neon demons at you than actual plot — I'm left wondering if I accidentally walked into an art installation instead.

Those fight scenes though! Like, are demon fights even a thing now? I guess they are because they choreographed the heck out of them. I'm almost convinced the director was possessed by some demon of his own, given how frantically everything was stitched together. Did anyone else notice that bizarre scene with the exploding volcano in the middle of the city? Because that's not going to be on any urban planning brochure.

> Anyway, the main dude, what's his name, Ron? No, Rash? Rant? Whatever, that guy definitely has that tortured hero vibe down. I mean, dude needs a nap and maybe a hug. It's not all brooding expressions and swinging swords, right? Or is it? I mean, I kind of envy his ability to just jump into chaos headfirst without crumbling into a pile of existential dread. Could use some of that energy when my alarm goes off at 6 AM, you know?

And then there's the soundtrack. It's like someone threw a synthesizer and an orchestra into a blender and hit puree. Like, am I supposed to be scared or just mildly confused? Probably both, since I couldn't decide if I wanted to shiver or dance.

Here's the weird thing: I kind of want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again and make sure I didn't hallucinate half of it. The logic's not there, but maybe the second time I’ll catch those nuances that went over my head like a possessed kite.

C# wise, this came to mind — no clue why: 
```csharp
if (demon.IsDefeated) { soul.Rest(); }
else { panic.Run(); }
```

But that ending though. I think it wanted to be profound? Little bit like reading a book where someone ripped out the last chapter. I don’t know. Maybe walk in with expectations set to ‘whatever’ and take it from there. Or not. Your call.
